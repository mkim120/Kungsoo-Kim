        <p>
          I'm an aspiring web developer with experience in back-end development
          and exposure to web design and user experience. I created this web
          page to detail my web development journey and showcase my current HTML
          and CSS skills. This page will also provide the opportunity to view my
          work and reach out to me to connect.
        </p>
      </div>
      <div id="about">
        <h2>About Me</h2>
        <p>
          I was born in South Korea and immigrated with my family to the United
          States at the age of seven. My birth name is Kungsoo (경수), but I
          also go by Michael as my "American" name. I have an immense passion
          and respect for my background and culture, and I strive to maintain
          and improve my Korean as a first generation immigrant.
        </p>

        <p>
          Currently, I am an Amazon Seller Support Associate for Korean and
          English speaking business partners selling on the Amazon platform.
          While I am able to utilize and hone my Korean language skills through
          this role, my goal is to change careers into the tech field. After
          graduating from the University of Pittsburgh with a Bachelor's degree
          in Information Science, I completed a Back-end Java Development boot
          camp focusing on Client-Server Programming (SQL, Spring, JPA, REST) as
          well as covering topics such as Data Structures, Algorithms, Design
          Patterns, Cloud/Microservice deployments, and DevOps (e.g. CI/CD).
        </p>

        <p>
          However, my passion has always been for Front-end Development and User
          Experience. I designed this web page to demonstrate my coding skills
          and to channel my creativity through web design, and I look forward to
          entering the tech industry to continue working on websites.
        </p>

        <h2>About the Web Page</h2>
        <p>
          Thanks for reading this far in my page! In the previous section, you
          learned about me and the purpose of this web page. I hope you got a
          better understanding of who I am and why I created this page.
        </p>

        <p>
          My website also includes a blog article on my journey to becoming a
          web developer. My blog will highlight what I've learned so far and
          what I've found most interesting. Please look forward to reading it!

        <h2>Blog: My Web Dev Journey</h2>
        <h5>By: Michael Kim | Posted: Aug 4, 2023</h5>
        <h3>The First Steps</h3>
        <p>
          After I graudated college and started working with Amazon, I didn't
          get the opportunity to enter the tech industry with my degree in
          Information Science. However, while working full-time, I took the
          chance to join a Back-end Java Development boot camp that focused on
          Client-Server Programming (SQL, Spring, JPA, REST) and covered topics
          such as Data Structures, Algorithms, Design Patterns,
          Cloud/Microservice deployments, and DevOps (e.g. CI/CD). This program
          served as a refresher for a lot of what I had learned in college and
          as a stepping stone into the world of web and software development.
        </p>

        <h3>Composing Code</h3>
        <p>
          However, I knew that my passion had always been for Front-end
          Development and User Interface design. I'd like to attest my interest in
          coding and design to my love for music and the arts. Since I was a
          child, I enjoyed playing and listening to music, and I started
          learning the piano and clarinet during grade school. When I entered
          high school, I was captivated by the world of percussion and joined
          the marching band to play keyboard percussion instruments like the
          <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Marimba" target="_blank"
            >marimba</a
          >
          and
          <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Vibraphone" target="_blank"
            >vibraphone</a
          >. In college, I was an active member of the varsity marching band in
          the baritone section and also performed in the symphonic band and
          basketball pep band.
        </p>
        <img
          class="blog-img"
          src="https://images.huffingtonpost.com/2016-06-29-1467212459-8532299-pianotocomputer.png"
          alt=""
        />
        <p>
          What I've found most interesting in my journey so far is that in music
          and coding, you're basically learning a new language. We learn to read
          notes and play them to create a song the same way that we learn syntax
          and write code to create programs. I've played an instrument for as
          long as I can remember, and realizing the shared principles between
          these two seemingly unrelated topics has allowed me to keep my mind
          open to all of the opportunities that are available within the vast
          field of technology.
        </p>

        <h3>The Next Steps</h3>
        <p>
          With this in mind, it's my goal to enter the world of web development,
          and as I continue to find bridges between my passion for music and
          tech, I desire to make an impact in the tech industry as a contributor
          who recognizes the significance of patience and consistency, whether
          that involves overcoming a difficult piece of music or dealing with a
          challenging coding problem. Contact me if you also love music and have
          a passion for technology, and let's discuss!

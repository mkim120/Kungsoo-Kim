#### HTML Structure
 
The quiz features a hidden element that is shown to provide feedback on the selected answer.
 
#### CSS Styling
 
Quiz content is centered on the page with suitable margins and padding for better readability and appearance. The answer options change background color on hover and the feedback messages use distinct colors (green for a correct answer, red for an incorrect answer).
 
#### Functionality
 
When an answer option is clicked, the other options are disabled (unclickable) and jQuery functions determine whether the answer is correct or not and provide feedback to the appropriate element.

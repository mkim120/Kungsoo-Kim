        <h2>Streaming Tower of Pizza (Pizza and Gaming)</h2>
        
        <p>Streaming Tower of Pizza is a pizza shop, bar, and gaming center located in Pittsburgh. They offer a large variety of games, including board and tabletop games, console games, several pinball machines, and the latest VR experiences on a pay-by-the-hour basis. The building is split into two areas - one for those just interested in enjoying pizza and drinks, and the other containing the gaming areas (food and drinks can be taken into the gaming areas). The location features reservable board game tables and group gaming areas, which can be reserved up to two weeks in advance. They host weekly board game nights, monthly gaming tournaments, and a twice-a-year “Game Jam”, a week-long event in which teams are invited to develop and present their own games.</p>
